/* Although many players may play in a single round of blackjack, 
 * it's fundamentally a two-player game. 
 * In blackjack, players don't play against each other; 
 * and they don't co-operate. The only competition is the dealer.
 * The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer,
 *  but without going over 21. 
 * You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards.
 * The cards 2 through 10 have their face value,
 *  J, Q, and K are worth 10 points each, 
 * and the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (player's choice).
  */  
 /*The player or players are dealt an initial two-card hand and add together 
  * the value of their cards. Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) 
  * are counted as ten points. A player and the dealer can count
  *  their own ace as 1 point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the 
  * numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards,
  *  players have the option of getting a "hit", or taking an additional card. 
  * In a given round, the player or the dealer wins by having a score of 21 
  * or by having the highest score that is less than 21. Scoring higher than 21 
  * (called "busting" or "going bust") results in a loss. 
  * A player may win by having any final score equal to or less than 21 
  * if the dealer busts. If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is 
  * called "soft", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking
  *  an additional card; 11 plus the value of any other card will always be
  *  less than or equal to 21. 
 * Otherwise, the hand is "hard".*/
